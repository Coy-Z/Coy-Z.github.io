        <p>
            The following are notes I wrote to accompany a 2 hr lecture at the 2024 UK physics team selection camp,
            with the objective to cover the broad topic of AC theory.
            Embedded are the filled AC notes and the gapped version can be found <a href="/files/AC_Notes_Gapped.pdf">here</a>.
