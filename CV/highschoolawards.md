# High School Awards

On this page, I list all of my achievements during my time in secondary education (age 11-18).

# Olympiads

## Physics Olympiads

### Silver Medal and 55th in the International Physics Olympiad - 07/2023

I scored 32/50 marks (22.5/30 in Theoretical and 9.5/20 in Practical) and placed 55th out of ~400 contestants. This earned me a silver medal and 2nd on the UK team.

### National Physical Laboratory Theoretical Physics Prize - 04/2023

1st in the country for BPhO round 3 theoretical exam and was awarded a cash prize and Stefano Profumo's "Introduction to Particle Dark Matter".

### Gold in the British Physics Olympiad Round 2 - 03/2023

I achieved a gold award and scored within the top 12 entrants in the country. This qualified me for the selection camp which took place at the University of Oxford.

During the selection camp, we engaged in 5 days of lectures, problems classes and exams. We were taught a range of topics, including Electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations in integrated form), Thermodynamics and Entropy, Wave theory, Special Relativity, AC theory, Rotational Dynamics and Optics. The exams consisted of a 2-hour practical, a 4-hour practical and a 1-hour theory.

Following on from this, I was selected as a member of the 5-man team, which competed in the International Physics Olympiad in July 2023.

### Gold in the British Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad - 03/2023

I achieved a gold award and scored within the top 12 entrants in the country.

### Top Gold in the British Physics Olympiad Round 1 - 01/2023

I achieved a Top Gold award and scored within the top 187 entrants in the country.

### Gold in the British Physics Olympiad Round 2 - 03/2022

I achieved a gold award and scored within the top 15 entrants in the country.

### Silver in the British Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad - 03/2022

### Top Gold in the British Physics Olympiad Round 1 - 12/2021

I achieved a Top Gold award and scored within the top 170 entrants in the country.

## Chemistry Olympiads

### Gold and Qualification for Team Selection Camp in the UK Chemistry Olympiad Round 1 - 02/2023

I scored within the top 33 entrants in the country. This qualified me for the second round which took place at the University of Nottingham. Unfortunately, due to collision with the physics selection camp, I was unable to attend.

### Roentgenium Award in the C3L6 - 07/2022

I scored the highest in school and placed in the top 0.7% of entrants in the Cambridge Chemistry Challenge for Lower Sixth, and was invited to partake in a residential at St Catherine's College, Cambridge.
On the residential, we were taught various concepts ranging from single-electron systems to the classification of organic reactions. We also attempted two practicals from the 2009 International Chemistry Olympiad. I was able to score perfect results in the second practical.

## Maths Olympiads

### Distinction in the British Maths Olympiad Round 1 - 01/2023

I was awarded a Distinction in the British Maths Olympiad, scoring the highest in the school.

### Distinction in the British Maths Olympiad Round 1 - 12/2021
