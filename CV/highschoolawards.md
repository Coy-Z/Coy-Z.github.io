On this page, I list all of my achievements during my time in secondary education (age 11-18).

# Olympiads

## Physics Olympiads

### Silver Medal and 55th in the International Physics Olympiad - 07/2023

I scored 32/50 marks (22.5/30 in Theoretical and 9.5/20 in Practical) and placed 55th out of ~400 contestants. This earned me a silver medal and 2nd on the UK team.

### National Physical Laboratory Theoretical Physics Prize - 04/2023

1st in the country for BPhO round 3 theoretical exam and was awarded a cash prize and Stefano Profumo's "Introduction to Particle Dark Matter".

### Gold in the British Physics Olympiad Round 2 - 03/2023

I achieved a gold award and scored within the top 12 entrants in the country. This qualified me for the selection camp which took place at the University of Oxford.

During the selection camp, we engaged in 5 days of lectures, problems classes and exams. We were taught a range of topics, including Electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations in integrated form), Thermodynamics and Entropy, Wave theory, Special Relativity, AC theory, Rotational Dynamics and Optics. The exams consisted of a 2-hour practical, a 4-hour practical and a 1-hour theory.

Following on from this, I was selected as a member of the 5-man team, which competed in the International Physics Olympiad in July 2023.
