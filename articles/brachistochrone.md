# Brachistochrone Problem

The problem objective is to find the shape of a slope connecting two points, such that a ball rolling down the slope (from the higher to lower point) would do so in the shortest time.

The mathematics I will use to solve this problem requires some understanding of matrix calculus, which I discuss in another <a href="/articles/matrixcalc/">article</a>.
