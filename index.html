            Hello! My name is Coy and I am an undergraduate student at Trinity College, University of Cambridge, currently studying Engineering.
            I use this website to dump projects, as well as blog posts on things I find interesting (mainly for future reference).
        </p>
        <p> My interests lie in several main areas:
            <ul>
                <li>autodifferentiation and applications to Machine Learning.</li>
                <li>Bayesian inference in image recognition.</li>
                <li>applications of autodifferentiation to large number of parameters in control theory.</li>
                <li>generic interests in physics and applied mathematics.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
