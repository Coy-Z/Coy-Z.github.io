        <p> 
            Hello! My name is Coy and I am an undergraduate student at Trinity College, University of Cambridge, currently studying Engineering.
            I use this website to dump projects, as well as blog posts on things I find interesting (mainly for future reference).
        </p>
        <p> My interests lie in several main areas:
            <ul>
                <li>reinforcement learning algorithms and deep learning.</li>
                <li>inverse kinematic algorithms, in particular, I am currently looking at the Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm.</li>
                <li>software design and graphics rendering.</li>
                <li>generic interests in physics and applied mathematics.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find my CV <a href="/CV/">here</a>.
